// Team members connected to a real AI agent. Everyone else stays a simulation.
// Keys are the exact team names used in public/office.js. Each member picks the model that fits the work:
// a stronger model for writing that needs judgement, a lighter one for patterned work. ANTHROPIC_MODEL in .env
// is the fallback for a member without a model.

// Shared rule: ask instead of guessing. The server turns an answer that starts with QUESTIONS: into a
// "Needs decision" task that waits for a person to answer.
